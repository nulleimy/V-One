# V-One / VOODOO One

> **Governed Change Authorization, Execution & Evidence Trust Plane**

V-One keeps consequential human- and AI-initiated operations explicit, bounded and independently
verifiable. It owns authority semantics; provider/runtime details remain behind governed boundaries.

## Canonical model

All current operations share the authority/execution prefix:

```text
ReviewedOperation
→ Approval
→ AuthorizationSnapshot
→ ExecutionGrant/v2
→ control-plane GrantConsumptionWitness/v1
→ durable Dispatch
→ ExecutionEpoch / Lease / Fence
→ isolated bounded Runner
→ provider effect / observation
```

The evidence tail is **profile-specific**, not universal:

```text
READ_ONLY_VERIFIED
→ independent Verifier
→ VerificationResult/v1

BOUNDED_MUTATION_VERIFIED
→ ExecutionReceipt/v2                 [effect claim, NOT verification]
→ independent Verifier
→ VerificationResult/v1
→ OperationProof/v2
→ OperationCell/v1
```

`ExecutionReceipt/v2` and `OperationProof/v2` are bounded-mutation contracts. READ-only verification
currently terminates at `VerificationResult/v1`.

```text
ExecutionReceipt != VerificationResult
execution succeeded != VERIFIED
VerificationResult != OperationProof
OperationProof != OperationCell
```

## Current state

### Historical runtime checkpoint

Latest retained full local runtime-attested development checkpoint:

```text
main@d57d37111b8bc9471a136b6c618aad8e920f1aff
archive SHA-256: 80e53da665fe122375900ac888fef3562b0182018c4f7492f355d3d3401f4df2
image ID: sha256:8342c2ac978343a59ef13d90bda5d89f3d06be2c3d25875665026f039eb99abc
```

It does not attest later source changes.

Current product truth:
[`CURRENT_PRODUCT_STATE.md`](CURRENT_PRODUCT_STATE.md) and
[`docs/product/CURRENT_CAPABILITIES.md`](docs/product/CURRENT_CAPABILITIES.md).

## One canonical language

Machine authority:

- `voodoo_product/vop_vocabulary.py`;
- `schemas/vop/registry.v1.json`.

Human projection:
[`docs/architecture/VOP_CANONICAL_VOCABULARY.md`](docs/architecture/VOP_CANONICAL_VOCABULARY.md).

Current semantic revision is `vop-terminology-freeze-r2` (ADR-0018). R2 makes the lifecycle
stage list an ordered superset and registers explicit terminal profiles/compatibility. It deliberately
does **not** call Receipt/v2 or Proof/v2 universal supersessions of the older v1 families.

Important boundaries:

```text
Approval != Authorization
AuthorizationSnapshot != ExecutionGrant
ExecutionGrant != ExecutionCapsule
Runner != Verifier
ExecutionReceipt != VerificationResult
Observation != VerificationResult
VerificationResult != OperationProof
OperationProof != OperationCell
Evidence-chain integrity != independent verification
Release != Deploy
```

Grant consumption belongs to the control plane **before Dispatch**. Runner authority is
`bounded_execution_only`.

## ProductComposition reality

The repository contains the accepted authority, durable dispatch, coordination, Runner, verifier and
bounded-mutation proof/cell components. Merged PR #128 established the canonical trust-plane runtime
as a `ProductComposition` seam: an explicit runtime factory must share the exact ProductService database
and `DatabasePermissionAuthority`, and the default application intentionally leaves the provider
runtime pack absent/fail-closed.

PR #137 merged the canonical READ HTTP surface. PR #140 reconciled that surface with restart-safe
durable resume and runtime resume wiring, without adding a provider WRITE route or default provider
runtime pack.

```text
COMPONENT COVERAGE = STRONG
HISTORICAL BOUNDED-MUTATION ATOM = VERIFIED
CANONICAL PRODUCT RUNTIME SEAM = IMPLEMENTED / MERGED
CANONICAL PUBLIC READ API = IMPLEMENTED / MERGED
RESTART-SAFE DURABLE RESUME = IMPLEMENTED / MERGED
DEFAULT PROVIDER RUNTIME PACK = DISABLED / FAIL-CLOSED
REAL DEFAULT-RUNTIME HTTP READ E2E = NOT VERIFIED
PROVIDER WRITE = BLOCKED
```

Legacy `ExecutionService` remains an explicit compatibility surface and is not canonical fallback
authority. Public READ API availability does not imply provider runtime activation, provider mutation,
deployment, or release.

## G0 governance evidence

The repository records immutable G0 evidence scopes, not a self-updating `current main = PASS` claim.
The latest retained G0 evidence is:

```text
workflow = g0-governance-verify
run = 34031128405
source_sha = a7e7c075dc44d61d4f7e8870cc3c0580ff290c2c
artifact = g0-governance-evidence-34031128405-1
artifact_id = 9988632821
artifact_digest = sha256:be646405590ac07f6293eaeb94a72c77ecf8ea02c16a31b31ccf93ef4ec92a2c
checksum_validation = PASS
retained_verdict = VERIFIED
```

That run independently verified the renamed `eimyroot/Voodoo-One` repository, exact source binding,
PR-only main, required `verify` from workflow `ci`, latest-head strict checks, force-push and deletion
disabled, conversation resolution, active rulesets and no ordinary bypass for that exact SHA.

```text
LATEST_RETAINED_G0_VERDICT=VERIFIED
LATEST_RETAINED_G0_SOURCE_SHA=a7e7c075dc44d61d4f7e8870cc3c0580ff290c2c
CURRENT_LIVE_G0=DERIVED_QUERY_ONLY
RELEASE_CANDIDATE_G0=FRESH_EXACT_CHECKOUT_REQUIRED
```

`CURRENT_LIVE_G0` must be derived from live GitHub state at decision time. A later commit changes
`main`, so this retained artifact cannot be reused as exact-current proof. The release-candidate
workflow therefore performs fresh G0 verification against its exact checked-out `${GITHUB_SHA}`.

The repository also retains the earlier G0 artifact for its original evidence scope:

```text
workflow = g0-governance-verify
run = 32553113424
source_sha = 76d74d2ed62b6e78f027728c456c22da0b4a95bd
artifact = g0-governance-evidence-32553113424-1
artifact_digest = sha256:6e63caee23a57613471df66ef0279c0261ed8d375e4c929accdf50eff7dc4f5f
historical_verdict = VERIFIED
```

Historical evidence stays historical. G0 evidence never authorizes provider runtime, release or
deployment by itself.

## READ before WRITE

The next governed direction is a READ-only G8 runtime pack followed by repeated real canonical HTTP
READ E2E and restart/resume verification. Provider WRITE remains blocked unless the adopted safety gate
is satisfied with evidence for READ E2E, restart continuity, no duplicate authority/effect, independent
verification, and fail-closed behavior. Even then, `ELIGIBLE` would not itself authorize a WRITE effect.

Execution success remains distinct from independent verification:

```text
execution.status      = SUCCEEDED
verification.verdict  = NOT_VERIFIED
```

is truthful and must not be promoted to `VERIFIED` by execution success, receipts, or hash integrity.

## Historical verified bounded-mutation atom

F6b run `32213563750` proved one staging rollback operation:

- `DELETE_REF` exactly once;
- mutation count `1`;
- automatic retry `false`;
- rollback `true`;
- Runner and independent Verifier observed `ABSENT`;
- `VerificationResult/v1 = VERIFIED / OBSERVED_STATE_MATCH`;
- `OperationProof/v2 = 40248a675287785778e1b0a8cc9ae9fd8fff12e869e820413f6fcea0ffcd1718`;
- `OperationCell/v1 = 2fc7de767018bdab8e08dcbfeffba988f16a4bc95694d2bf94b7854408e0a7b5`.

This is real bounded-mutation evidence, not evidence that every READ produces Proof/v2/Cell/v1 or that
a new provider mutation is authorized.

## Security posture

- production effects default disabled;
- one-time grant consumption in control plane;
- exact current user/global-role/workspace/environment/membership permission revalidation before durable grant store/consume;
- exact target/capsule/dispatch/epoch/fence bindings in current contracts;
- SQLite migrations through schema 14;
- bounded isolated pilot runtimes;
- separate independent verifier path;
- receipt/verification semantics separate;
- canonical public READ API and restart-safe resume are merged;
- default G8 provider runtime and real product HTTP READ E2E remain blocked/unverified;
- provider WRITE remains blocked behind READ-before-WRITE evidence and separate effect authorization;
- no release/deployment inferred from CI, merge, Proof or Cell;
- latest retained G0 evidence is exact-SHA scoped; current live GitHub governance is queried/derived rather than versioned as PASS.

Normative governance remains in
[`WORLD_CLASS_SOFTWARE_DEVOPS_OPERATING_MODE.md`](WORLD_CLASS_SOFTWARE_DEVOPS_OPERATING_MODE.md),
[`PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md`](PROJECT_CONSTITUTION.md), and effective adopted records/ADRs. ADR-0019
remains `PROPOSED` until its governed adoption gate closes.

## Local verification

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements-dev.lock
python -m ruff check .
python -m compileall -q voodoo_product scripts tests
python -m pytest -q
python scripts/product_readiness_gate.py
```

No command above enables production effects.

## Local checkpoint verification

```bash
export PATH="$PWD/scripts:$PATH"
voodoo evidence verify /absolute/path/to/checkpoint
```

Equivalent:

```bash
python -m voodoo_product evidence verify /absolute/path/to/checkpoint
```

Checkpoint verification does not independently attest provider state, publish artifacts, authorize a
release or enable production effects. See
[`ADR-0002`](docs/adr/ADR-0002-local-checkpoint-proofgraph-verification.md).

## Local start

Create `.env.product.local` from `.env.product.example`, replace secret placeholders, configure exact
`VOODOO_TRUSTED_HOSTS`, and keep:

```text
VOODOO_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_EFFECTS=false
```

Then:

```bash
set -a
. ./.env.product.local
set +a
.venv/bin/uvicorn voodoo_product.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --no-access-log --no-server-header
```

Console: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/console`

## Change governance

- focused reviewable commits;
- behavior changes include tests;
- CI is not release/deploy authority;
- production effects remain separately authorized/released;
- authentication/authority/persistence/evidence/write/release changes use governed review;
- automation cannot create stronger authority by inference.
