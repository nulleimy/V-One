The exact live `main` identity must be queried directly. The G7 merge SHA above is snapshot provenance, not a self-updating current-main claim.

## Historical checkpoint boundary

The latest retained full runtime-attested checkpoint remains historical evidence for exactly
`main@d57d37111b8bc9471a136b6c618aad8e920f1aff`:

```text
POST_MERGE_CHECKPOINT_ZIP_SHA256=80e53da665fe122375900ac888fef3562b0182018c4f7492f355d3d3401f4df2

```

Historical documentation-review merge `57c7bf2277616c4445039865ac7cf81c5fada858` remains ADR-0008 evidence-index provenance only; it is not the current Git baseline.

## Truth dimensions

Do not collapse these dimensions:

```text
CONTRACT / COMPONENT      = source implementation exists
PRODUCT_COMPOSED          = ProductComposition can own/use the component through the canonical path
DEFAULT_RUNTIME_ACTIVE    = the default application actually instantiates a provider runtime pack
LIVE_VERIFIED             = real runtime/provider evidence exists for the named scope
PRODUCT_SURFACED          = API/UI exposes the same semantics truthfully
RELEASED / DEPLOYED       = separately governed states
```

## G0 GitHub governance — retained evidence vs live-derived truth

Current canonical repository identity is `eimyroot/Voodoo-One`. The latest retained post-rename G0
evidence independently verified repository identity, required-check provenance and live ruleset controls
for exactly the SHA that it observed. This versioned document records that immutable evidence scope; it
does not promote the repository's moving current `main` to PASS by self-reference.

```text
workflow = g0-governance-verify
run = 34031128405
event = workflow_dispatch
branch = main
source_sha = a7e7c075dc44d61d4f7e8870cc3c0580ff290c2c
branch_head_sha = a7e7c075dc44d61d4f7e8870cc3c0580ff290c2c
verifier_source_sha = a7e7c075dc44d61d4f7e8870cc3c0580ff290c2c
required_check = verify
required_workflow = ci
required_workflow_path = .github/workflows/ci.yml
artifact = g0-governance-evidence-34031128405-1
artifact_id = 9988632821
artifact_digest = sha256:be646405590ac07f6293eaeb94a72c77ecf8ea02c16a31b31ccf93ef4ec92a2c
checksum_validation = PASS
retained_verdict = VERIFIED
verified_at = 2026-09-06T11:45:16.520493Z
```

The verifier observed PR-only main, required `verify` from GitHub Actions workflow `ci`, latest-head
strict checks, force-push disabled, branch deletion disabled, conversation resolution, no ordinary
admin/ruleset bypass, active rulesets and exact verifier-source binding. All required G0 checks were
true for that exact evidence scope.

Current live G0 is deliberately not stored as a mutable-looking PASS/FAIL field in Git. It is derived
at decision time by comparing live `main` and live settings with fresh verifier evidence. Release-candidate
construction must run G0 against its exact checked-out `${GITHUB_SHA}` rather than reuse this retained
artifact as current authorization.

The earlier retained artifact remains valid historical evidence for the repository identity and source
SHA that existed when it ran:

```text
workflow = g0-governance-verify
run = 32553113424
event = workflow_dispatch
branch = main
source_sha = 76d74d2ed62b6e78f027728c456c22da0b4a95bd
artifact = g0-governance-evidence-32553113424-1
artifact_id = 9470619984
artifact_digest = sha256:6e63caee23a57613471df66ef0279c0261ed8d375e4c929accdf50eff7dc4f5f
evidence_json_checksum = 11a99765485b63b70186037011d31c105dea8dd75b689e0036a8766d05e8137d
historical_verdict = VERIFIED
```

Historical evidence stays historical. Neither retained run is silently promoted to proof for a later
`main` SHA.

```text
REPO_ENFORCEMENT_CONTRACT       = IMPLEMENTED
LATEST_RETAINED_G0_VERDICT      = VERIFIED
LATEST_RETAINED_G0_SOURCE_SHA   = a7e7c075dc44d61d4f7e8870cc3c0580ff290c2c
CURRENT_LIVE_G0                 = DERIVED_QUERY_ONLY
P0_GITHUB_GOVERNANCE            = QUERY_LIVE_FOR_DECISION
```

G0 evidence does not authorize provider runtime, release, deployment or production effects.

## Canonical shared authority/execution prefix

```text
ReviewedOperation
→ Approval / ApprovalCertificate
→ AuthorizationSnapshot
→ ExecutionGrant/v2
→ GrantConsumptionWitness/v1          [CONTROL PLANE ONLY]
→ DispatchOutboxEntry/v1
→ DispatchEnvelope/v1
→ DispatchInboxAdmission/v1
→ ExecutionEpoch + ExecutionLease/v1
→ ExecutionCapsule/v1
→ profile-specific terminal
```

`CanonicalOperationPipeline.prepare()` stops before Runner/provider effect and retains exact bound runtime objects for the terminal router. Grant consumption remains control-plane-before-Dispatch; Runner never issues or consumes ExecutionGrant.

## Capability-bound terminal selection

Terminal strength is not caller-selected. The immutable capability definition determines the terminal profile. G7 additionally narrows the public READ path to exactly:

```text
terminal_profile = READ_ONLY_VERIFIED
capability       = github.read-ref/v1
```

A caller-supplied `terminal_profile` is rejected. Route/profile/capability mismatch fails before Grant issuance/consumption.

## Runtime permission authority

`DatabasePermissionAuthority` remains the current permission source for canonical product composition. Every permission decision re-reads the ProductService database and requires the current active user, global role permission, exact workspace/environment, and current user↔workspace membership. A stale Principal, role downgrade, deactivation, or membership revocation cannot preserve stronger canonical authority.

## Canonical G7 public Operation API — merged

PR #137 is merged. PR #140 reconciles that API with durable resume and runtime resume wiring.

```text
GET  /api/v1/operations/status
POST /api/v1/operations/{request_id}/read
```

The response keeps execution and independent verification separate. This remains a valid truthful state:

```text
execution.status      = SUCCEEDED
verification.verdict  = NOT_VERIFIED
```

Execution success, receipt existence, digest integrity, or evidence-chain integrity must never manufacture `VERIFIED`.

No canonical CREATE_REF, DELETE_REF, or rollback HTTP route exists.

## Restart-safe durable resume — merged

Canonical resume reconstructs the same already-authorized execution from durable evidence. It requires the original actor and current DB permission, validates durable snapshot/grant/consumption/outbox/envelope/inbox/lease evidence, resolves the terminal profile server-side, and rechecks the current execution fence.

Resume must not:

```text
re-enter CanonicalOperationPipeline.prepare()
issue a second ExecutionGrant/v2
consume the grant a second time
append a second outbox/inbox admission
reacquire a lease
accept a parallel DB / permission authority / profile registry / fence
```

PR #140 fixed reviewed nested-ownership cases so runtime/composition revalidates the canonical DB ownership of snapshot store, permission authority, and current fence.

## Canonical terminal profiles

### READ_ONLY_VERIFIED

```text
isolated READ Runner
→ Runner observation
→ durable completion
→ independent Verifier
→ ObservedPostState/v1
→ VerificationStrength/v1
→ VerificationResult/v1
```

For READ:

```text
ExecutionReceipt/v2 = NOT_APPLICABLE
OperationProof/v2   = NOT_APPLICABLE
OperationCell/v1    = NOT_APPLICABLE
```

### BOUNDED_MUTATION_VERIFIED

```text
bounded provider mutation
→ ExecutionReceipt/v2
→ independent verifier
→ VerificationResult/v1 = VERIFIED
→ OperationProof/v2
→ OperationCell/v1
```

Current reusable CREATE_REF and DELETE_REF/rollback orchestration stop at pre-effect artifacts. No current provider mutation is authorized by G7.

## Hard READ-before-WRITE boundary

Provider WRITE remains blocked until the same canonical product path repeatedly proves a real authenticated HTTP READ through independent `VerificationResult/v1`, including process restart and durable resume of the same execution.

Required gate:

```text
READ_E2E             = VERIFIED
RESTART_RESUME       = VERIFIED
NO_DUPLICATE_EFFECT  = VERIFIED
AUTHORITY_CONTINUITY = VERIFIED
INDEPENDENT_VERIFY   = VERIFIED
FAIL_CLOSED          = VERIFIED

WRITE_RUNTIME_GATE   = ELIGIBLE
```

`ELIGIBLE` still does not authorize provider WRITE; WRITE requires a later explicit effect-specific gate and authorization.

## G8 current boundary

G8 is the next implementation gate. The first default provider runtime pack is READ-only and must reuse existing canonical components rather than create a parallel provider or authority framework. It must use explicit configuration, separate Runner and Verifier credential decisions/identities, the exact ProductComposition DB/permission authority/profile registry/current fence, and no ambient credential fallback.

Until G8 is implemented and real HTTP READ E2E is verified:

```text
DEFAULT_PROVIDER_RUNTIME = OFF
REAL_CANONICAL_READ_E2E = NOT_VERIFIED
WRITE_RUNTIME_GATE = BLOCKED
PRODUCTION_EFFECTS = DISABLED
```

## Historical bounded mutation evidence

Historical F6b run `32213563750` remains one complete bounded staging operation:

```text
provider operation = DELETE_REF
provider mutation count = 1
automatic retry = false
rollback = true
Runner readback = ABSENT
independent verifier readback = ABSENT
VerificationResult = VERIFIED / OBSERVED_STATE_MATCH
OperationProof/v2 = 40248a675287785778e1b0a8cc9ae9fd8fff12e869e820413f6fcea0ffcd1718
OperationCell/v1  = 2fc7de767018bdab8e08dcbfeffba988f16a4bc95694d2bf94b7854408e0a7b5
```

This historical evidence does not authorize or prove any new provider mutation.

## Governance history

- Engineering operating standard remains hash-bound to `36d2798f377ee5e6ba05ea8a565fc053ad58182d95a3af4f466050d536285bed`.
- Historical PR #125 technical merge/post-state is VERIFIED; separate pre-merge merge-authorization provenance remains **NOT VERIFIED** and is not rewritten.
- ADR-0018 records the R2 terminal-profile correction instead of silently rewriting older history.
- PR #128 reconciliation remains historical provenance; later G7 evidence does not rewrite it.
- Historical G0 run `32553113424` remains retained evidence for its original repository identity and exact source SHA.
- Latest retained G0 run `34031128405` VERIFIED the renamed canonical repository at exact `main@a7e7c075dc44d61d4f7e8870cc3c0580ff290c2c`; current live G0 remains derived/query-only.
