## Reading this document

Capability status is evidence-scoped. A component can be `IMPLEMENTED` while its default provider
runtime remains disabled. `VERIFIED` means the named evidence scope was actually demonstrated; it does
not imply current provider execution, release, deployment or production authority.

Ask separately:

```text
Does the contract/component exist?
Is it tested?
Is it ProductComposition-capable?
Is the default provider runtime active?
Is there real provider/runtime evidence?
Is it surfaced truthfully in API/UI?
Is it released/deployed?
```

## Verified command surfaces

### Canonical public Operation API — G7 merged

PR #137 is merged and PR #140 reconciles its READ surface with restart-safe durable resume/runtime wiring:

```text
GET  /api/v1/operations/status
POST /api/v1/operations/{request_id}/read
```

The READ route requires an authenticated principal with the outer `execution.run` permission, a
bounded `Idempotency-Key` and correlation id. The canonical runtime independently revalidates current
DB-backed role, active state, environment and workspace membership. The request model rejects unknown
fields, so callers cannot inject a terminal profile.

The READ route is internally narrowed to:

```text
terminal_profile = READ_ONLY_VERIFIED
capability       = github.read-ref/v1
```

A mismatch fails before Grant issuance/consumption. Missing READ terminal/runtime also fails before
canonical authority preparation. OpenAPI contains no canonical CREATE_REF, DELETE_REF or rollback
route.

The response keeps execution and independent verification separate. The following is valid and must
not be promoted to VERIFIED:

```text
execution.status      = SUCCEEDED
verification.verdict  = NOT_VERIFIED
```

Without G8, the default `canonical_operation_runtime` remains `None`; surfacing the endpoint does not
activate a provider runtime or ambient credentials.

### Restart-safe resume

Merged PR #140 reconstructs the same durable execution after process restart from retained canonical
evidence. Resume must not re-enter `CanonicalOperationPipeline.prepare()` and must not issue a second
grant, consume the grant again, append another outbox/inbox admission, or reacquire a lease. It also
revalidates current database permission, durable bindings, terminal profile, envelope revision, and
current execution fence before returning a process-local prepared execution.

## Canonical ProductComposition shape

```text
ProductService database
        ↓
DatabasePermissionAuthority
        ↓
current user + role + active state + workspace membership
        ↓
CanonicalOperationPipeline
        ↓
immutable capability→terminal profile
        ↓
CanonicalOperationRuntime
        ├── READ_ONLY_VERIFIED
        │    → CanonicalGitHubReadTerminal
        │    → VerificationResult/v1
        │    → durable restart/resume of the same execution
        │
        └── BOUNDED_MUTATION_VERIFIED
             ├── CREATE_REF → A09CreateRefPreparer → WriteEffectPreflight/v1 → STOP
             └── DELETE_REF → A09RollbackPreparer → RollbackWriteEffectPreflight/v2 → STOP
```

The runtime factory must share the exact ProductService database and permission-authority instance.
Without an explicit provider/runtime pack the default composition remains fail-closed. Workspace
membership is a scope check, not activation of the separately PROPOSED Solo/Team/Regulated policy.

## G0 governance evidence — current vs historical

Current canonical repository identity is `eimyroot/Voodoo-One`. A fresh post-rename G0 observation on
the exact current `main` SHA has not yet been retained, so current GitHub governance status is
`UNKNOWN` and must fail closed for release-candidate promotion.

The following retained artifact remains VERIFIED historical evidence for the exact repository identity
and source SHA that existed when it ran:

```text
workflow = g0-governance-verify
run = 32553113424
event = workflow_dispatch
source_sha = 76d74d2ed62b6e78f027728c456c22da0b4a95bd
artifact = g0-governance-evidence-32553113424-1
artifact_id = 9470619984
artifact_digest = sha256:6e63caee23a57613471df66ef0279c0261ed8d375e4c929accdf50eff7dc4f5f
evidence_json_checksum = 11a99765485b63b70186037011d31c105dea8dd75b689e0036a8766d05e8137d
historical_verdict = VERIFIED
```

That historical evidence verified PR-only main, required `verify` from workflow `ci`, latest-head
strict checks, force-push and deletion disabled, conversation resolution, no ordinary bypass, active
rulesets, and source binding for its exact evidence scope. It is not current post-rename proof. A fresh
G0 PASS on the exact repaired `main` may promote current GitHub governance back to `VERIFIED`; G0 never
authorizes release/deploy by itself.

## Verified historical complete operation atom

Historical F6b run `32213563750` proves one bounded staging operation through effect, independent
readback and portable proof/cell composition:

```text
DELETE_REF
→ ExecutionReceipt/v2 (mutation count 1, automatic retry false)
→ Runner ABSENT observation
→ independent Verifier ABSENT observation
→ VerificationResult/v1 = VERIFIED / OBSERVED_STATE_MATCH
→ OperationProof/v2
→ OperationCell/v1
```

Retained identities:

```text
OperationProof/v2 = 40248a675287785778e1b0a8cc9ae9fd8fff12e869e820413f6fcea0ffcd1718
OperationCell/v1  = 2fc7de767018bdab8e08dcbfeffba988f16a4bc95694d2bf94b7854408e0a7b5
```

This is historical evidence for one real atom. It does not execute or authorize a new provider mutation.

## Release boundary

```text
VOODOO_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_EFFECTS=false
NEW_G7_PROVIDER_WRITE=NO
NEW_A09_PROVIDER_MUTATION=NO
G0_LIVE_ENFORCEMENT_VERIFIED=UNKNOWN_CURRENT
G8_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_RUNTIME=OFF
REAL_CANONICAL_READ_E2E_VERIFIED=NO
WRITE_RUNTIME_GATE=BLOCKED
RELEASE_VERIFIED=NO
DEPLOYMENT_VERIFIED=NO
```

No merge, CI pass, public API surface, preflight, historical pilot, proof or cell changes those values
by inference.

## Historical reconciliation closure evidence

PR #128 reconciliation is complete and merged. The exact final pre-merge head
`fcdd43578860bf8bf01f85b3f088bb5c6d21526c` passed CI #839, D4b #157, E3 #148 and E4b #144. The
remaining organizational-review independence risk was explicitly accepted for that historical merge;
that fact is not a standing bypass for later high-risk changes.

## Update rule

Update this inventory whenever a contract, composition path, live evidence scope, public truth
surface, governance boundary or release state materially changes. Preserve historical evidence rather
than silently promoting it into current capability claims.
